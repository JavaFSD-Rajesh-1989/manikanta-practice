Request serialization in the context of JSP and servlets means that requests are processed one at a time in sequence rather than concurrently. 

This approach is usually applied when the isThreadSafe attribute is set to false in a JSP page.

- Single Request Access: When isThreadSafe="false" is set in a JSP page, the web container serializes requests, ensuring that only one request can access and execute the JSP page at a time.
- Queueing Requests: If multiple requests are made to this JSP page, the web container places them in a queue, processing them one after the other.
- Synchronized Execution: This essentially creates a synchronized execution environment where the web container locks the JSP page for each request,

in Seevlets

- Synchronized service() Method:
- SingleThreadModel Interface

Alternatives
- Avoid shared (instance) variables in servlets or use synchronized blocks only on specific code sections.
- Use HttpSession or ServletContext to manage data in a thread-safe way
