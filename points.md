- Only try block is MANDATORY.
- With a try block, we can use either a catch block or finally block as needed.
- variable scope refers to the accessibility and lifetime of a variable within the code.
    1. Class Scope (Static/Class Variables)
    2. Instance Scope (Instance Variables)
    3. Method Scope (Local Variables)
    4. Block Scope (Loop or Conditional Statements)
- **User Story:** Describes what needs to be built from the user's perspective.
- **Story Point:** Estimates how much work is needed to build it.
- TRUNCATE is the DDL statement whereas DELETE is a DML statement.
- An inner join is a join of two tables returning only matching rows.
- INNER JOIN joins to tables together based on a matching column(s) whereas INTERSECT joins queries together based on matching entire records with each other.
- A left or right outer join returns the results of the inner join as well as the unmatched rows in the left or right table respectively.
- A full outer join returns results of an inner join as well as the results of a left and right join.
- A function is in **2NF** form if it has no partial functional dependencies.
- A repository in Maven holds build artifacts and dependencies of varying types. There are exactly two types of repositories: local and remote:
- Serialization is the process of writing the state of an object to a byte stream.
- By default, event handlers are set to the bubbling phase.
- `onhover` is not a javascript event
- In JavaScript, a closure is an inner function that has access to its outer function's scope, even after the outer function has returned.

#### Key Differences in Scope Between Lambda and Anonymous Classes

| Feature                    | Lambda Expression                | Anonymous Class                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **`this` reference**       | Refers to the enclosing class   | Refers to the anonymous class instance |
| **Own scope**              | No new scope created            | Has its own scope, can define new fields and methods |
| **Local variables**        | Can only access effectively final variables from the enclosing scope | Same as lambda (only effectively final) |
| **Functional interface**   | Only used with functional interfaces | Can implement interfaces or extend classes with multiple methods |
