## ArrayList

- for fetching list of users by noticing the drawabacks of array.
- collection framework.
- `instanceod ` we can check which class.
- to overcome performance issues while getting type of item in a list we should use **generics** or generic collection;

        ArrayList<user> users = service.allUsers();

j

## Wrapper classes

- **boxing:** primitive data type to object.
- **unboxing:** object to primitive data type.
- **autoboxing:** system will do boxing & unboxing for you.

`hashCode()` gives uniqueness to object. `equals()` checking uniqueness

## Abstract Class

## Interface

## Inner classes

- forcing you to make a class to be private, protected, static.
- we can use outer class feature inside inner class directly (follows static rules).
- in other case outer class need to instanciate the inner class.
- we can also create class inside the method.
- `OuterClass&InnerClass` for executing innerclass having `main()`

constructor may be `public`, `private`, `protected` and default. we cannot modify constructor like `static`, `abstract`, `final`.
