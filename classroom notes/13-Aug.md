## Multi threading

`java` execute java programms on console, `appletviewer` execute java program on browser.

A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. 

Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.
