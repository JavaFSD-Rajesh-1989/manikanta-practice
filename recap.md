### notes

`List<Integer> mylist = new ArrayList<>();` concepts **polymorphism**, generics, wrapper classes, constructor.

Checked exceptions must ALWAYS not be caught in a try-catch block. we also delacre it in throws

[equals method of primitive wrapper class](https://javaconceptoftheday.com/equals-method-java-lang-object-class/)

1. **symmetric** => `a.equals(b)` returns same as `b.equals(a) `
2. **transitive** => if `a.equals(b)` and `b.equals(c) `return true, then `a.equals(c)` returns true.
3. **reflexive** => `a.equals(a)` return true.
4. **consistent** => provided information used in equals() method on objects is not changed.
